            <h2>The Fundamental Three</h2>
            <center>

            <p>Competitive Pokemon has many aspects, many of which are incredibly advanced. Understanding
            the deeper aspects of competitive Pokemon comes with many years of experience and intuition.
            However, if we look closer, we can see that the theories of competitive Pokemon arise from these
            three Fundamental Aspects: Type, Stats, and Abilities. These three aspects are the foundation of 
            any competitive team or player, and knowledge of these aspects are non-negotiable when progressing
            through the ranks. </p>

            <h3>The Type Chart</h3>
            <center>
                <img src="../assets/typechart.jpg" alt="The Type Chart" height="400px" width="550px">
            </center>
            <p>The type is one of the most important concepts in competitive play, as it is
            a defining characteristic of a Pokemon's performance in battle. A
            Pokemon's type determines its strengths and weaknesses, which in turn directly
            influence a Pokemon's damage input and output. There are 18 different types in total,
            and each type has its own strengths and weaknesses against others. Because of the type
            matchup, moves against other Pokemon may be "super effective" (dealing significantly
            more damage), "not very effective" (dealing significantly less damage), or not effective
            at all (dealing no damage.) </p>

            <p>A pokemon's type may also provide a general description of a pokemon's nature and stats.
            For instance, some types are known for their high durability, some types are chosen for high
            attack and speed, some types have abilities that are meta-defining, and some types have great
            variety in resistances against other types. </p>

            <p> The image above shows the <b>type chart,</b> a diagram showing the strengths and 
            weaknesses of each type in relation to another. White tiles show a neutral relationship
            (same amount of damage), while green tiles show a super-effective relationship, and 
            red tiles show a not very-effective relationship. Black tiles signify a not-at-all 
            effective relationship, indicating that the damage dealt by a move will be nullified 
            because of the type matchup involved in a battle.</p>

            <p>The table below shows all eighteen types of Pokemon, along with a general overview
            of their natures and their advantages/disadvantages: </p>

            <p> Familiarizing oneself with the types and type matchups in Pokemon
            is non-negotiable. Because of the significant damage boosts/debuffs 
            type matchups can give, depending on the type(s) of Pokemon in a team,
            the tide of battle may range from a guaranteed win to a quick loss. 
            Knowing the meta is not enough for competitive play. Players with a
            strong understanding of types and type matchups will have
            an easier time building effective teams and therefore maximizing their
            chances of winning in battle.                                          
            </p>

             <h3>Stats</h3>
            <center>
                <img src="../assets/stats.jpg" alt="Stats" height="400px" width="550px">
            </center>

            <p> Every Pokemon has six stats that define its capabilities in battle. These are
            namely Hit Points (also known as HP, which is how much damage a Pokemon can take
            before fainting), Attack (how much damage a Pokemon can deal with physical moves),
            Defense (how much damage a Pokemon can resist from physical moves), Special Attack
            (how much damage a Pokemon can deal with special moves), Special Defense (how much
            damage a Pokemon can resist from special moves), and Speed (determines which
            Pokemon moves first in battle). </p>

            <p> Additionally, every species of Pokemon has their base stats. These are stats
            that a Pokemon is "born with," and they essentially determine a Pokemon's preferred 
            role on the battlefield. They are the same for all Pokemon of a species. For instance,
            Garchomp has high speed and attack base stats, while Blissey has high HP. These pokemon
            have exceptional base stats; and therefore they have become popular options in competitive
            play.  </p>
        
            <h3>IVs</h3>
            <center>
                <img src="../assets/ivchart.jpg" alt="Stats" height="400px" width="550px">
            </center>

            <p> However, base stats are not the only factor that determines a Pokemon's stats.
            Every Pokemon has Individual Values (IVs), which are hidden values that range from 0
            to 31 for each stat. IVs are fixed and cannot be changed once a Pokemon is born, similar
            to base stats. These values are randomly generated when a Pokemon is encountered
            or bred, and they determine how much a Pokemon's stats will increase as it levels up.
            Higher IVs in a stat will result in higher stats for that specific stat. The highest
            IV value is 31, which is preferred for competitive matchup. </p>

            <h3>EVs</h3>
            <img src="../assets/weakEV.jpg" alt="Weak EVs" height="300px" width="450px"> <img src="../assets/strongEV.jpg" alt="Strong EVs" height="300px" width="450px">

            <p> Every Pokemon also has Effort Values (EVs). Unlike IVs or Base Stats, EVs may be changed
            through various methods such as training, fighting, etc, hence the name: "Effort" Values.
            On the left, the EV distribution of the Turtwig remains small, meaning it hasn't specialized
            in any aspect of combat. However, on the right, the EV distribution of the Garchomp is highly 
            skewed to the Attack stat. The high value of EVs in the Attack stat significantly boosts the 
            Garchomp's damage output. </p>

            <h3>Abilities</h3>
            <center>
                <img src="../assets/pokemonabilities.jpg" alt="Abilities" height="400px" width="550px">
            </center>

            <p> An ability in Pokemon is a special attribute unique to each species of Pokemon.
            Abilities have the potential to greatly affect the outcome of battle. Some abilities
            give debuffs to opposing Pokemon, some abilities give boosts to the Pokemon possessing
            it, and others may alter the environment of the battlefield. There are a few common 
            types of abilities Pokemon may have, namely: </p>
